# smoothness
A [Java EE 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_EE) web application template and [JSP tag library](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnama.html) based on the [JQuery UI Smoothness](https://jqueryui.com/themeroller/) theme.  The included demo web application showcases the template layout.

## Build
This [Java 8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) project uses the [Gradle 5](https://gradle.org/) build tool to automatically download dependencies and build the project from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/smoothness
cd smoothness
gradlew build
```
**Note**: If you do not already have Gradle installed, it will be installed automatically by the wrapper script included in the source

**Note**: Jefferson Lab has an intercepting [proxy](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/92c25a033db93a90184a5994e71d0b78)

## Publish

You can publish new versions of this library to BinTray.  First ensure you have the bintray token configured in your [user gradle properties](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/dff89309ecdc424f134fdf02ceb41906).
