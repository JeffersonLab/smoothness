<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_EE">Jakarta EE 10</a> web application template and
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnama.html">JSP tag library</a> based on the
    <a href="https://jqueryui.com/themeroller/">JQuery UI Smoothness</a> theme.</p>
<div class="overview">
    A Smoothness web application is organized using the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSP_model_2_architecture">JSP Model 2 Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture</a>.
    With this approach the model is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBeans">Java Bean</a>, a Java object
    that has get/set
    methods such that <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gjddd.html">Expression Language</a> can be
    used to reference the model in the view.  Most model classes used are a special type of Java Bean, a
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnbqa.html">JPA Entity</a>,
    which allows easy persistence into a database.   The view is implemented with JSP and JSP tag files.
    The controller is implemented with
    Java Servlets and Filters.   The Java code is further organized by three packages: persistence, business, and presentation.
    The persistence package defines models, and leverages Hibernate / JPA to persist models into a database.  The
    business package houses any business rules or logic and retrieves models from the persistence layer and provides
    them to the presentation layer.  The presentation layer houses the Servlets and Filters which calls on the business layer to
    retrieve and persist models and provides them to JSP views.  This isolation by layer helps with separation of concerns and
    ensures only the model is shared across layers and each layer only can call into the one below it
    (example: there are no SQL queries directly in JSP, per general best practice for large complex apps).
